# Components of Credit

*Suggested timing: 30 minutes* 

You probably know that every learning circle has a few common components:
- A facilitator
- A meeting place
- A group of co-learners
- A shared learning resource


So what makes a credit bearing learning circle different?
- The facilitator has been trained (this is part of it)
- The meeting place is in the US, outside of California (for now)
- Participants complete a Learning Journal alongside the learning circe
- The learning resource has been vetted in advance by College Unbound

Let's dig more into each of these items.

## Trained Facilitator
There are only two requirements of th facilitator: you review the materials included in this module and you either faciltite a non-credit learning circle and/or join a free [virtual facilitator orientations](https://www.p2pu.org/en/events/).

## Meeting in the US
For now, college credit can only be awarded to learning circles that meet in the US (in-person or virtually) outside of the California due to state laws which limit the transferability of distance learning credit. If you're in California and want to offer a similar program, reach out and we can explore possibilities together.

## Learning Journals
For participants, the major difference is that they
 must complete a personal learning journal, which includes a weekly reflection, a wrap-up activity in their learning circle, and a few assignments based on course materials. Read more, and access the template for creating Learning Journals, [in our Knowledge Base](https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/nominating-a-course-for-credit).

## Approved Learning Resource
Any learning material is theoretically eligible for college credit, but you must share your plans with the P2PU and CU team beforehand so that we can assign a credit value. Generally, learning circles must meet at least 5 times in order to earn one collge credit. Courses that have already been verified for credit are listed [in our Knowledge Base](https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/currently-approved-courses_)

The process for proposing new learning resources for credit will be covered in the following module.
