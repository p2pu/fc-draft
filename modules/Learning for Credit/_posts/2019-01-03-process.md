# Running Your First Learning Circle For Credit

*Suggested timing: 30 minutes* 
## Before the Learning Circle Begins
Once you've decided to facilitate for credit, you should reach out to us and let us know if you want our help promoting your learning circle on the [Learning Circles for Credit website](https://www.p2pu.org/collegeunbound/). In our Knowledge Base, we [outline a few suggestions](
https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/facilitator-resources#before-the-learning-circle-begins) on how to set expectations for participants in the learning circle. Our recommendation is that credit is optional, i.e. you allow credit-seeking and non-credit seeking participants join the same learning circle, but this is ultimately up to you.

## During the Learning Circle
Your primary task during the learning circle is to facilitate as you would a normal learning circle, providing a little additional guidance to those seeking credit. It's important to emphasize that you are not their teacher, and you are not grading them. You are welcome to help review their materials if you want, but it's neither required nor expected. Two additional readings:
- [During the Learning Circle](https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/facilitator-resources#during-the-learning-circle) section of our Knowledge Base.
- [Learner FAQs](https://docs.p2pu.org/frequently-asked-questions#credit-bearing-faqs), which are linked from the public-facing [Learning Circles for Credit website](https://www.p2pu.org/collegeunbound/).

Once we receive a Leaning Journal from a participant, we will review the documents and award credit; nothing more is required from you.

## Nominating a Course for Credit
We generally suggest that you choose a course that has already been approved for credit for for your first learning circle, however this isn't requrired. Our Knowlwege Base outlines the process for [nominating a course](https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/facilitator-resources#nominating-a-course-for-credit), as well as some tips and suggestions for writing a good course nomination form.
